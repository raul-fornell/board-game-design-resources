## Print and play

Websites where you can download or purchase print-and-play board games are great for seeing how other designers prepare their files and provide a cheap way to try new games. Many of these games are also quick to play, small, or designed for solo play.

## Game design tools

Software that helps to design or prototype games.

- <https://machinations.io/> The online cloud tool for design economies with the machinations framework.
- [Old Flash version](https://github.com/DleanJeans/Machinations) Simpler, but just works and doesn't need internet. Probably you will need like me, an open source player emulator like [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/)
- <https://www.figma.com/> I specially like the visual components with custom values and variants [explained here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma)
