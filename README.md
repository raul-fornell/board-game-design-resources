## Print and play

Websites where you can download or purchase print-and-play board games are great for seeing how other designers prepare their files and provide a cheap way to try new games. Many of these games are also quick to play, small, or designed for solo play.

## Game design tools

Software that helps to design or prototype games.

- <https://machinations.io/> The online cloud tool for design economies with the machinations framework.
- [Old Flash version](https://github.com/DleanJeans/Machinations) Simpler, but just works and doesn't need internet. Probably you will need like me, an open source player emulator like [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/)
- <https://www.figma.com/> I specially like the visual components with custom values and variants [explained here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma)
- <https://www.18xx-maker.com/> Tool for creating specifically 18XX maps.

## Monetizing

Places where you can try to sell your board games without a publisher. Notice, links here appear in other sections too.

- <https://gumroad.com/> I found this place for the game [Mini Rogue](https://mountaingold.gumroad.com/l/MiniRogue12), that has been published in physical format years later. I put 2 games there, but didn't sell anything, so I hope somebody else has more luck than me.
- <https://www.pnparcade.com/> The first print and play gamed I bought here was [Sprawlopolis](https://www.pnparcade.com/products/spawlopolis?_pos=1&_sid=d64f1f461&_ss=r), and I liked so much that bought later the wallet retail version.
- <https://www.thegamecrafter.com/> I bought here the [Gate](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/gate1) solo deckbuilding game and loved the format and quality.
